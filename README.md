## Description
### How to play?
- You control a bobber, you move it by tilting your phone
- Catch fishes by moving your bobber near to them. Beware though as some fishes are hostile and cannot be touched!
- After a round of fishing, you can buy items from a shop to improve your run. Benefits enjoyed from items will increase if you own 1/3/9 of that item
